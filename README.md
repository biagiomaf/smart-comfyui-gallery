## What is SmartGallery?

**SmartGallery** turns your ComfyUI output folder into a fast, searchable, mobile-friendly web gallery.

Every generated file (image or video) is automatically linked to its **exact ComfyUI workflow**, even if:
- ComfyUI is not running
- the file was generated weeks or months ago
- filenames are meaningless

Everything runs **fully offline**, locally, with no cloud and no tracking. 
 
**Who is this for?**  
ComfyUI users who generate a lot, iterate fast, and want to *never lose a workflow again*.

---

## Why it exists

If you use ComfyUI seriously, you probably faced this:

- Thousands of outputs with generic filenames
- Forgotten workflows
- Hard to search by what you actually remember
- No usable way to browse from your phone

SmartGallery turns your output folder into a **living memory of your creative process**.

**Actively developed** — frequent updates focused on real ComfyUI workflows.  

## What’s New in v1.55
In this release, along with several other features, we are introducing a brand-new tool for analyzing videos

<div align="center">
  <img src="assets/storyboard.png" width="900" alt="New Storyboard Overview">
  <br>
  <em>The 11-frame Grid covering the entire duration from Start to the Last Frame</em>
</div>
<br>

- **Video Storyboard & Analysis** Instantly analyze video content with a clean 11-frame Grid covering the entire duration from Start to the True Last Frame.
- **Options Menu:** New persistent **`⚙️ Options`** menu (Desktop/Mobile) to manage core gallery settings.
- **Thumbnail Grid Size:** Added a new toggle in the Options menu (`⚙️`) allowing users to switch between **Normal** and **Compact** view on desktop. 
- **Focus Mode:** A new streamlined view. Hides UI clutter and changes click behavior to "Select Only" for rapid batching. Accessible via the **`⚡`** button or **`Q`** key.
- **Shortcuts Button:** Added many shortcuts and a dedicated `? Shortcuts` button in the desktop header for Quick Actions description.
- **Generation Dashboard:** Added a high-fidelity summary panel at the top of the Node Summary to show Seed, Model, Steps, and Prompts at a glance.
- **Smart Video Grid:** Completely rewritten "Play/Pause on Scroll" engine. Videos strictly pause when leaving the viewport, drastically reducing CPU/GPU usage.
- **Video Autoplay Control:** A session-based toggle to enable/disable video autoplay in the grid. (Default: OFF). **`P`** key shortcut to quickly toggle the Video Autoplay setting.
- **Dynamic UX for Videos:**
    - On **Desktop**, when Autoplay is OFF, a small ▶ icon appears in the corner. Clicking it plays the video in-grid for quick preview.
    - On **Mobile**, the thumbnail is fully clickable to open the Lightbox (Click-to-Open).
- **Auto-Consistency:** The system forces a robust Full Sync on every startup to remove "ghost" files deleted externally via OS.

This is a curated summary — see the 👉 full [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md) for all technical changes.

**⚠️ IMPORTANT:** Replace the example paths with your real paths. Use forward slashes `/` even on Windows.
```bat
@echo off
cd /d %~dp0
call venv\Scripts\activate.bat

:: --- CONFIGURATION ---
:: REPLACE these paths with your actual folders.
:: NOTE: Use forward slashes (/) for paths (e.g., C:/ComfyUI/output)

set "BASE_OUTPUT_PATH=C:/Path/To/ComfyUI/output"
set "BASE_INPUT_PATH=C:/Path/To/ComfyUI/input"
set "BASE_SMARTGALLERY_PATH=C:/Path/To/ComfyUI/output"

:: If ffmpeg is not in your system PATH, point to ffprobe.exe here:
set "FFPROBE_MANUAL_PATH=C:/Path/To/ffmpeg/bin/ffprobe.exe"
set SERVER_PORT=8189

:: --- START ---
python smartgallery.py
pause
```

Double-click `run_smartgallery.bat` to start.

### 🐳 Docker Deployment 

Want to run SmartGallery in a containerized environment? We've got you covered!

> 🎖️ **Special Thanks**: A huge shout-out to **[Martial Michel](https://github.com/mmartial)** for orchestrating the Docker support and contributing to the core application logic.

Docker deployment provides isolation, easier deployment, and consistent environments across different systems. However, it requires some familiarity with Docker concepts.

**🗄️ Pre-built images**

Pre-built images are available on DockerHub at [mmartial/smart-comfyui-gallery](https://hub.docker.com/r/mmartial/smart-comfyui-gallery) and Unraid's Community Apps.

* Fully optional
* Runs locally
* Separate Docker container or Python environment
* No impact on the core gallery if not installed

The AI service is currently **under development and not released yet**.
