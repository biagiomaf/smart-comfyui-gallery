# Changelog

## [1.22] - 2025-10-08

### Changed

#### index.html
- Minor aesthetic improvements

#### smartgallery.py
- Implemented intelligent file management for moving files between folders
- Added automatic file renaming when destination file already exists
- Files are now renamed with progressive numbers (e.g., `myfile.png` â†’ `myfile(1).png`, `myfile(2).png`, etc.)

### Fixed
- Fixed issue where file move operations would fail when a file with the same name already existed in the destination folder
- Files are now successfully moved with the new name instead of failing the operation
